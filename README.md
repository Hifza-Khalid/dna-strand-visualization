# 🧬 DNA Strand Visualization

## Overview

The **DNA Strand Visualization** project provides an accurate and dynamic representation of a **DNA double-helix structure** using **pure HTML and CSS**. This project employs **CSS keyframe animations** to simulate the helical twisting and periodic motion characteristic of real DNA molecules. The visualization aims to illustrate the fundamental architecture of genetic material while maintaining a visually compelling and scientifically inspired aesthetic.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Pure HTML & CSS Representation** – Constructed without JavaScript, ensuring lightweight execution.
- 🔄 **Helical Motion Simulation** – Uses advanced CSS keyframe animations to replicate the characteristic twisting movement of a DNA strand.
- 🌙 **Optimized Dark-Themed Visualization** – Enhances visual contrast and readability while preserving a modern scientific appearance.
- 📏 **Responsive & Scalable Design** – Adaptable to different screen sizes to ensure accessibility and usability across various devices.

## 🚀 Implementation & Usage

### Prerequisites

This project requires only a modern web browser capable of rendering **CSS animations**.

### Deployment & Execution

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Execute the following command in a terminal to download the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hifza-Khalid/dna-strand-visualization.git
   ```

2. **Access the Project Directory**  
   ```sh
   cd dna-strand-visualization
   ```

3. **Launch the Visualization**  
   Open `index.html` in a web browser to observe the animated double-helix structure in motion.

## 🛠️ Scientific & Technical Framework

This visualization is grounded in fundamental molecular biology principles and computational design methodologies:

- **HTML** 🏗️ – Provides the structural framework for the DNA strands and backbone.
- **CSS** 🎨 – Implements keyframe animations to emulate the **double-helix rotation, base-pair alignment**, and **periodic undulation** characteristic of real DNA structures.

## 📌 Project Architecture
